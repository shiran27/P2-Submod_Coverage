abstract = {The problem of safe planning and control for multi-drone systems across a variety of missions is of critical importance, as the scope of tasks assigned to such systems increases. In this paper, we present an approach to solve this problem for multi-quadrotor missions. Given a mission expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), our controller maximizes robustness to generate trajectories for the quadrotors that satisfy the STL specification in continuous-time. We also show that the constraints on our optimization guarantees that these trajectories can be tracked nearly perfectly by lower level off-the-shelf position and attitude controllers. Our approach avoids the oversimplifying abstractions found in many planning methods, while retaining the expressiveness of missions encoded in STL allowing us to handle complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements. Through experiments, both in simulation and on actual quadrotors, we show the performance, scalability and real-time applicability of our method.},

abstract = {Recently it has been shown how various results on the behaviour of exact and approximate primal algorithms for certain discrete location problems can be obtained by studying the more general problem of maximising a submodular set function. Unfortunately, this more general model tells us little about an important aspect of the discrete location problems, their linear programming relaxations and the possible use of dual solutions in obtaining bounds. Here we examine a slightly more specialised model that again generalises the location problems of interest, but now also includes the continuous aspects of the problems missing from the earlier model, namely the problem: ${\rm max}\{w(y)\colon \sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{j}y_{j}\leq b,0\leq y_{j}\leq 1\}$ of maximising a real-valued nondecreasing piecewise linear, concave submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint. We show that a continuous greedy heuristic always attains at least $(1-e^{-1})\times 100\%$ of the optimal value, and that for the discrete problem an adapted greedy heuristic always attains 35\% of the optimal value. Specialised to the capacitated and uncapacitated location problems these results permit us to strengthen earlier results, and to obtain new results on dual greedy heuristics.},

abstract = {Greedy algorithms are widely used for problems in machine learning such as feature selection and set function optimization. Unfortunately, for large datasets, the running time of even greedy algorithms can be quite high. This is because for each greedy step we need to refit a model or calculate a function using the previously selected choices and the new candidate. Two algorithms that are faster approximations to the greedy forward selection were introduced recently [Mirzasoleiman et al., 2013, 2015]. They achieve better performance by exploiting stochastic evaluation and distributed computation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance guarantees for submodular functions. In this paper we show that divergent from previously held opinion, submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees for these two algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our result extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of functions. Furthermore, we show that a bounded submodularity ratio can be used to provide data dependent bounds that can sometimes be tighter also for submodular functions. We empirically validate our work by showing superior performance of fast greedy approximations versus several established baselines on artificial and real datasets.},

abstract = {Submodular maximization is a general optimization problem with a wide range of applications in machine learning (e.g., active learning, clustering, and feature selection). In large-scale optimization, the parallel running time of an algorithm is governed by its adaptivity, which measures the number of sequential rounds needed if the algorithm can execute polynomially-many independent oracle queries in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for an algorithm to be efficient in practiceâ€”there are many applications of distributed submodular optimization where the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by these applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of submodular maximization. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint $k$ that runs in $O(\log(n))$ adaptive rounds and makes $O(n \log(k))$ oracle queries in expectation. In our empirical study, we use three real-world applications to compare our algorithm with several benchmarks for non-monotone submodular maximization. The results demonstrate that our algorithm finds competitive solutions using significantly fewer rounds and queries.},

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target? We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions , we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63\% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees , our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

Under approximation preserving reductions, this problem is also equivalent to the "sparse approximation" problem of approximating signals concisely. We propose and analyze exact and approximation algorithms for several special cases of practical interest. We give an FPTAS when the covariance matrix has constant band-width, and exact algorithms when the associated covariance graph, consisting of edges for pairs of variables with non-zero correlation, forms a tree or has a large (known) independent set. Furthermore, we give an exact algorithm when the variables can be embedded into a line such that the covariance decreases exponentially in the distance, and a constant-factor approximation when the variables have no "conditional suppressor variables". Much of our reasoning is based on perturbation results for the R 2 multiple correlation measure, frequently used as a measure for "goodness-of-fit statistics". It lies at the core of our FPTAS, and also allows us to extend exact algorithms to approximation algorithms when the matrix "nearly" falls into one of the above classes. We also use perturbation analysis to prove approximation guarantees for the widely used "Forward Regression" heuristic when the observation variables are nearly independent.},

For such signals, which are generated by systems whose states are equipped with non-trivial metrics, for example continuous or hybrid, robustness is not only natural, but also a critical measure of system performance. Thus, we propose multi-valued semantics for MTL formulas, which capture not only the usual Boolean satisfiability of the formula, but also topological information regarding the distance, $\epsilon$, from unsatisfiability. We prove that any other signal that remains $\epsilon$-close to the initial one also satisfies the same MTL specification under the usual Boolean semantics. Finally, our framework is applied to the problem of testing formulas of two fragments of MTL, namely Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and closed Metric Temporal Logic (clMTL), over continuous-time signals using only discrete-time analysis. The motivating idea behind our approach is that if the continuous-time signal fulfills certain conditions and the discrete-time signal robustly satisfies the temporal logic specification, then the corresponding continuous-time signal should also satisfy the same temporal logic specification. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In multi-agent systems, robots transmit their planned trajectories to each other or to a central controller, and each receiver plans its own actions by maximizing a measure of mission satisfaction. For missions expressed in temporal logic, the robustness function plays the role of satisfaction measure. Currently, a Piece-Wise Linear (PWL) or piece-wise constant reconstruction is used at the receiver. This allows an efficient robustness computation algorithm-a.k.a. monitoring-but is not adaptive to the signal class of interest , and does not leverage the compression properties of more general representations. When communication capacity is at a premium , this is a serious bottleneck. In this paper we first show that the robustness computation is significantly affected by how the continuous-time signal is reconstructed from the received samples, which can mean the difference between a successful control and a crash. We show that monitoring general spline-based reconstructions yields a smaller robustness error, and that it can be done with the same time complexity as monitoring the simpler PWL reconstructions. Thus robustness computation can now be adapted to the signal class of interest. We further show that the monitoring error is tightly upper-bounded by the L âˆž signal reconstruction error. We present a (non-linear) L âˆž-based scheme which yields even lower monitoring error than the spline-based schemes (which have the advantage of being faster to compute), and illustrate all results on two case studies. As an application of these results, we show how time-frequency specifications can be efficiently monitored online.},

Our previous work presented a method for using finitely many human generated trajectories to synthesize a non-optimal safety controller. We propose a formal method for optimizing the human generated trajectories used to synthesize the controller. Our method is based on the calculus of variations, but is different from other similar algorithms in that it uses a gradient descent based approach to directly solve the optimization problem without formulating the optimality conditions given by the Pontryagin Minimum Principle. This method provides a tool for improving the performance of a controller synthesized using the methods outlined in our previous work. We present an example of optimizing a human generated trajectory for a nonlinear system, specifically a quadrotor, and quantify the improvements it is able to generate. {\textcopyright} 2013 AACC American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {The automatic analysis of transient properties of nonlinear dynamical systems is a challenging problem. The problem is even more challenging when complex state-space and timing requirements must be satisfied by the system. Such complex requirements can be captured by Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) specifications. The problem of finding system behaviors that do not satisfy an MTL specification is referred to as MTL falsification. This paper presents an approach for improving stochastic MTL falsification methods by performing local search in the set of initial conditions. In particular, MTL robustness quantifies how correct or wrong is a system trajectory with respect to an MTL specification. Positive values indicate satisfaction of the property while negative values indicate falsification. A stochastic falsification method attempts to minimize the system's robustness with respect to the MTL property. Given some arbitrary initial state, this paper presents a method to compute a descent direction in the set of initial conditions, such that the new system trajectory gets closer to the unsafe set of behaviors. This technique can be iterated in order to converge to a local minimum of the robustness landscape. The paper demonstrates the applicability of the method on some challenging nonlinear systems from the literature. {\textcopyright} 2013 AACC American Automatic Control Council.},

Given a nonlinear dynamical system and an MTL specification for that system, our goal is to find a trajectory that violates or satisfies the specification. This trajectory can be used as a concrete feedback to the system designer in the case of violation or as a trajectory to be tracked in the case of satisfaction. The search for such a trajectory is conducted over the space of initial conditions, system parameters and input signals. We convert the trajectory search problem into an optimization problem through MTL robust semantics. Robustness quantifies how close the trajectory is to violating or satisfying a specification. Starting from some arbitrary initial condition and parameter and given an input signal, we compute a descent direction in the search space, which leads to a trajectory that optimizes the MTL robustness. This process can be iterated to reach local optima (min or max). We demonstrate the method on examples from the literature. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {Modern control systems, like controllers for swarms of quadrotors, must satisfy complex control objectives while withstanding a wide range of disturbances, from bugs in their software to attacks on their sensors and changes in their environments. These requirements go beyond stability and tracking, and involve temporal and sequencing constraints on system response to various events. This work formalizes the requirements as formulas in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), and designs a controller that maximizes the robustness of the MTL formula. Formally, if the system satisfies the formula with robustness r, then any disturbance of size less than r cannot cause it to violate the formula. Because robustness is not differentiable, this work provides arbitrarily precise, infinitely differentiable, approximations of it, thus enabling the use of powerful gradient descent optimizers. Experiments on a temperature control example and a two-quadrotor system demonstrate that this approach to controller design outperforms existing approaches to robustness maximization based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming and stochastic heuristics. Moreover, it is not constrained to linear systems.},

We require that the control synthesis is carried out locally at the subsystem-level, without explicit knowledge of the dynamics of other subsystems in the network. We solve this problem in two steps. First, we provide distributed subsystem-level dissipativity analysis conditions whose feasibility is sufficient to guarantee dissipativity of the networked system. We then use these conditions to synthesize controllers locally at the subsystem-level, using only the knowledge of the dynamics of that subsystem, and limited information about the dissipativity of the subsystems to which it is dynamically coupled. We show that the subsystem-level controllers synthesized in this manner are sufficient to guarantee dissipativity of the networked dynamical system. We also provide an approach to make this synthesis compositional, that is, when a new subsystem is added to an existing network, only the dynamics of the new subsystem, and information about the dissipativity of the subsystems in the existing network to which it is coupled are used to design a controller for the new subsystem, while guaranteeing dissipativity of the networked system including the new subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this synthesis in enabling plug-and-play operations of generators in a microgrid by extending our results to networked switched systems.},

abstract = {In control theory, complicated dynamics such as systems of (nonlinear) differential equations are controlled mostly to achieve stability. This fundamental property, which can be with respect to a desired operating point or a prescribed trajectory, is often linked with optimality, which requires minimizing a certain cost along the trajectories of a stable system. In formal verification (model checking), simple systems, such as finite-state transition graphs that model computer programs or digital circuits, are checked against rich specifications given as formulas of temporal logics. The formal synthesis problem, in which the goal is to synthesize or control a finite system from a temporal logic specification, has recently received increased interest. In this article, we review some recent results on the connection between optimal control and formal synthesis. Specifically, we focus on the following problem: Given a cost and a correctness temporal logic specification for a dynamical system, generate an optimal control strategy that satisfies the specification. We first provide a short overview of automata-based methods, in which the dynamics of the system are mapped to a finite abstraction that is then controlled using an automaton corresponding to the specification. We then provide a detailed overview of a class of methods that rely on mapping the specification and the dynamics to constraints of an optimization problem. We discuss advantages and limitations of these two types of approaches and suggest directions for future research.},

Unfortunately, these cost functions are non-smooth and non-convex, and exact solutions using mixed-integer programming do not scale well. Recent work has focused on using smooth approximations of robustness, which enable faster gradient-based methods to find local maxima, at the expense of soundness and/or completeness.

Finding an approximate simulation relation between the full "concrete" system and a simplified "abstract" system establishes a bound on the output error between the two systems, allowing one to design a controller for the abstract system while formally certifying performance on the concrete system. However, many real-world control systems are subject to external disturbances, which are not accounted for in the standard approximate simulation framework. We present a notion of robust approximate simulation, which considers external disturbances to the concrete system. We derive output error bounds for the case of linear systems subject to two types of additive disturbances: bounded disturbances and a sequence of (unbounded) impulse disturbances. We demonstrate the need for robust approximate simulation and the effectiveness of our proposed approach with a simulated robot motion planning example.},

The objective is to minimize a measure of mean overall node state uncertainty evaluated over a finite time interval. In prior work, a class of distributed threshold-based parametric controllers has been proposed where agent dwell times at nodes and transitions from one node to the next are controlled by enforcing thresholds on the respective node uncertainties. Under such a threshold policy, on-line gradient-based techniques are then used to determine optimal threshold values. However, due to the non-convexity of the problem, this approach leads to often poor local optima highly dependent on the initial thresholds used. To overcome this initialization challenge, in this paper, the asymptotic steady-state behavior of the agent-target system is extensively analyzed for a single-agent system and dense graphs. Based on the obtained theoretical results, a computationally efficient off-line greedy technique is developed to systematically generate initial thresholds. Extensive numerical results show that the initial thresholds obtained lead to significantly better results than the locally optimal solutions known to date.},

We tie a utility function to the probability of detecting an event in each point of interest and use it to incentivize the agents to visit the geographical nodes with higher probability of event occurrence. We show that the design of an optimal monitoring policy that specifies the sequence of the geographical nodes and time of visit of those nodes for each mobile agent so that the utility of event detection over a mission horizon is maximized is an NP-hard problem. To reduce the time complexity of constructing the feasible set of the optimal approach and also to induce robustness to changes in event occurrence and other operational factors, we consider a receding horizon approach. We note that, with the number of agents growing, the cost of finding the optimal path grows exponentially even with shortened horizon. To overcome this issue, we introduce a sub-modular optimization approach that has a polynomial time complexity and also comes with a known sub-optimality lower bound.
